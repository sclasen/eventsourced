    Configuration
    -------------

    Processor --> reliable request-reply channel --> Destination
       ^                                                 |
       |                                                 |
       --------------------------------------------------

    In this example the Destination is local, but usually it is a remote
    actor accessed over an unreliable network. A Processor sends requests
    to a Destination and the Destination eventually replies.

    Properties
    ----------

    - Processor persists request and reply messages (Eventsourced processor)
      so that any state derived from past communications can be recovered
      during replay.
    - Request-reply is re-tried on destination failures (no response, failure
      response, network problems ...) but also during recovery after processor
      failures (JVM crashes, ...).
    - Processor will either receive a reply from Destination or a failure
      message (DestinationNotAvailable or DestinationFailure) from the
      reliable request-reply channel.
    - Delivery guarantees are at-least-once for both requests to Destination
      as well as replies to Processor.
    - Delivery confirmations (acknowledgements) are done by application logic.
      A request-reply is considered as complete when Processor positively
      confirms the receipt of the reply. Otherwise it is re-tried (either
      immediately or during recovery after a crash).
    - Reliable request-reply also can be used to deal with 'external updates'
      and 'external queries' as described by Martin Fowler
      * http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html#ExternalUpdates
      * http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html#ExternalQueries
    - Reliable request-reply channels can also be used by an event-sourced
      'error kernel' for communication with collaborators that may fail. In
      this example, the Processor is the error kernel and the channel is a
      child actor executing operations that may fail.
